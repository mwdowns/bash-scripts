### WORK SHELL SCRIPTS

This is a collection of shell scripts I use to automate tedious tasks I do at work.

I've set the folder (scripts) these files are in within my /Users/user.name folder, which is reflected in some of the paths to call a script in some of the files. If you put these scripts in a different folder, be sure to update those paths.

Also, a lot of these scripts are aliased. For example typing "v" will call the vagrant.sh script for my computer. Set those up as you see fit.

Hope these prove useful.
